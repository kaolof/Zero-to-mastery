Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element (h2,p{}---> i want h2 and p have the same properties)
element element (h2 p{} ---> i want to select all 'p' that are inside h2)
element > element (h2>p{}---> i want to select all p's -all paragraphs- that have a parent of 'h2')
element + element (select any 'p' element that is exactly next to 'h2' element)
:hover (h2>p{}---> at the first sight it looks like nothing are hapening and that part dosen't hace properties, but when you put the cursor above the element you 
	will be able to see the properties that you configured on the css doc)
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
